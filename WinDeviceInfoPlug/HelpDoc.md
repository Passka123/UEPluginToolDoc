### Basic Description  

This product is a Unreal Engine (UE) plugin for retrieving common hardware/software information from Windows devices. It combines **CPU ID**, **motherboard serial numbers**, and other identifiers to generate a **unique device fingerprint**, primarily used for **software activation** and **tamper-proofing**. All core interfaces have been **exposed as Blueprint function interfaces**, ensuring seamless integration without concerns about interface accessibility.

### Functional Description  
1. **Retrieve CPU Unique ID**  
   Obtains the processor's unique identifier via CPUID instruction or system APIs (e.g., Windows `wmic` commands).

2. **Retrieve Hard Disk ID**  
   Fetches the **logical identifier** generated by the operating system or software (may vary across system environments).

3. **Retrieve Physical Hard Disk ID**  
   Extracts the **hardware-level serial number** permanently written by the manufacturer (immutable and reliable for device identification).

4. **Retrieve MAC Address**  
   Acquires the **physical address** of network interfaces (e.g., Ethernet/Wi-Fi adapters), uniquely identifying devices at the data link layer.

5. **Enumerate Processes**  
   Lists **names of all currently running applications**, enabling runtime program monitoring and management.

### Technical Notes  
- The plugin leverages Windows system APIs (e.g., `GetSystemFirmwareTable`, `wmic`, and network stack tools) for hardware data collection.  
- Device fingerprints combine **immutable identifiers** (CPU ID, physical HDD ID) with **environment-dependent data** (logical HDD ID) for balanced security and flexibility.  
- Process enumeration aligns with OS-level process management mechanisms like Windows Task Manager or `Process` class in .NET.
